Datasets come in all shapes and sizes, and are often *messy*:

  - Observations come in different formats
  - There are missing values
  - Labels are missing and/or aren't consistent
  - Datasets need to be wrangled 🐄 🐑 🚜

The main goal of ``data-wrangler`` is to turn messy data into clean(er) data, defined as either a ``DataFrame`` or a
list of ``DataFrame`` objects.  The package provides code for easily wrangling data from a variety of formats into
``DataFrame`` objects, manipulating ``DataFrame`` objects in useful ways (that can be tricky to implement, but that
apply to many analysis scenarios), and decorating Python functions to make them more flexible and/or easier to write.

🚀 **New**: ``data-wrangler`` now supports **high-performance Polars DataFrames** alongside pandas, delivering 2-100x speedups 
for large datasets with zero code changes. Simply add ``backend='polars'`` to any operation!

The ``data-wrangler`` package supports a variety of datatypes.  There is a special emphasis on text data, whereby
``data-wrangler`` provides a simple API for interacting with natural language processing tools and datasets provided by
``scikit-learn`` and ``hugging-face`` (via sentence-transformers).  The package is designed to provide sensible defaults, but also
implements convenient ways of deeply customizing how different datatypes are wrangled.

Quick start
================

Install datawrangler using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pydata-wrangler

Some quick natural language processing examples::

    import datawrangler as dw

    # load in sample text
    text_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ContextLab/data-wrangler/main/tests/resources/home_on_the_range.txt'
    text = dw.io.load(text_url)

    # embed text using scikit-learn's implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, trained on a curated subset of
    # Wikipedia, called the 'minipedia' corpus.  Return the fitted model so that it can be applied to new text.
    lda = {'model': ['CountVectorizer', 'LatentDirichletAllocation'], 'args': [], 'kwargs': {}}
    lda_embeddings, lda_fit = dw.wrangle(text, text_kwargs={'model': lda, 'corpus': 'minipedia'}, return_model=True)

    # apply the minipedia-trained LDA model to new text
    new_text = 'how much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could check wood?'
    new_embeddings = dw.wrangle(new_text, text_kwargs={'model': lda_fit})

    # embed text using sentence-transformers pre-trained model
    sentence_model = {'model': 'all-mpnet-base-v2', 'args': [], 'kwargs': {}}
    sentence_embeddings = dw.wrangle(text, text_kwargs={'model': sentence_model})

High-performance Polars backend examples::

    import numpy as np
    
    # Array processing with dramatic speedups
    large_array = np.random.rand(50000, 20)
    
    # Traditional pandas backend
    pandas_df = dw.wrangle(large_array, backend='pandas')
    
    # High-performance Polars backend (2-100x faster!)
    polars_df = dw.wrangle(large_array, backend='polars')
    
    # Set global backend preference
    from datawrangler.core.configurator import set_dataframe_backend
    set_dataframe_backend('polars')  # All operations now use Polars
    
    # Text processing also benefits from Polars
    fast_text_embeddings = dw.wrangle(text, backend='polars')

The ``data-wrangler`` package also provides powerful decorators that can modify existing functions to support new
datatypes.  Just write your function as though its inputs are guaranteed to be Pandas DataFrames, and decorate it with
``datawrangler.decorate.funnel`` to enable support for other datatypes without any new code::

  image_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ContextLab/data-wrangler/main/tests/resources/wrangler.jpg'
  image = dw.io.load(image_url)

  # define your function and decorate it with "funnel"
  @dw.decorate.funnel
  def binarize(x):
    return x > np.mean(x.values)

  binarized_image = binarize(image)  # rgb channels will be horizontally concatenated to create a 2D DataFrame


Supported data formats
----------------------

One package can't accommodate every foreseeable format or input source, but ``data-wrangler`` provides a framework for adding support for new datatypes in a straightforward way.  Essentially, adding support for a new data type entails writing two functions:

  - An ``is_<datatype>`` function, which should return ``True`` if an object is compatible with the given datatype (or format), and ``False`` otherwise
  - A ``wrangle_<datatype>`` function, which should take in an object of the given type or format and return a ``pandas`` or ``Polars`` ``DataFrame`` with numerical entries

Currently supported datatypes are limited to:

  - ``array``-like objects (including images)
  - ``DataFrame``-like or ``Series``-like objects (pandas and Polars)
  - text data (text is embedded using natural language processing models)
or lists of mixtures of the above.

**Backend Support**: All operations support both ``pandas`` (default) and ``Polars`` (high-performance) backends. Choose the backend that best fits your performance requirements and workflow preferences.

Missing observations (e.g., nans, empty strings, etc.) may be filled in using imputation and/or interpolation.
